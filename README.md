# Accident Analysis in Zurich
Data science project for the introduction to data science course at UZH in spring semester 2021.

Questions that we tried to answer:

Which features in the data set are significant when accidents occur, correlations?
Can we classify certain features in dependence of a subset of other features?

Can we find the underlying probability distribution of the samples?
and what do they tell us?
