# Accident Analysis in Zurich
Data science project for the introduction to data science course at UZH in spring semester 2021.

Questions that we tried to answer:

Which features in the data set are significant when accidents occur, correlations?
Can we classify certain features in dependence of a subset of other features?

Can we find the underlying probability distribution of the samples?
and what do they tell us?

All the raw and tidy data are in the `/data` folder. Further descriptions and how the data is aquired
is saved in `/data/descriptions`. Also there is a presentation we made in the, whu guessed it, `/presentation` folder.
