- linear regression + F-test, to look for correlations and relations in general
  - find features which have a negligible correlation, they will be excluded from the kerneldensity estimation

- correlation between severity and involvement of pedestrians
- correlation between severity and roadtype

- find hotspots  overall 
  - one for bike
  - one for pedestrian
  - one for cars
  - one for motorcycle
  - etc.

If time:
- classification for accident type
- correlation between number of parking lots and accidents

For comedic relife:
- pets death rate and accidents invlving animals
- rear-end collisions and birth-rate
