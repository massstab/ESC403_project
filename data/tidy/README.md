This is the folder for the tidy dataset. Defined as this:

• each variable you measure in one column

• each different observation in one row

• one table for each “kind” of variable

• have ID to link multiple tables if necessary

• use descriptive names (e.g., AgeAtDiagnosis, not ADx)

• CSV or tab-delimited text files work great
