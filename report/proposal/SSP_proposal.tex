\section{Answers to questions}

\subsection{What is the general topic?}
We want to analyze what circumstances lead to accidents in Zurich and if we can project a heat map displaying the probability of high risk areas in the future.   
\subsection{What questions will you try to answer with the project?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correlation, causation?\vspace{0.2cm}\\
     Performing statistical inference on the given data set will be used to get a grasp why certain accidents occurred (the causes might be very trivial). Once these are established, preventative measures will be proposed if there are any. 
     
    \item Prediction, prevention? \vspace{0.2cm}\\
    After establishing a sound basis why accidents occur, day time, weather and other features will be used to predict high risk areas for accidents in the future (this might also be trivial, high rate of accidents $\Rightarrow$ high risk area). 
    
    \item Just for fun. \vspace{0.2cm}\\
    If by chance certain correlations arise that clearly do not imply causation, it will surely be exploited for comedic relief.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What data will you be using (and what is the source of that data)?}
We will use the road accident data of Zurich, the corresponding weather data and the Geo data catalogue. (road condition data? exist?)

\subsection{How will data be processed?}
Once the data has been cleaned and checked for any anomalies, classification will be used to classify the accident cause. Further 

\subsection{What analysis techniques or algorithms are planned to be used?}
